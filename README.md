# High-School-Shit

Sloppy attempt of a 16 year old me at dev

This project is more of nostalgic importance. 
With backend, frontend and database all in the same file, It was a pretty bad start to development.

>Self-criticism helps in improvement.

`still,` this project involves the use of python for backend, its library tkinter for the frontend and mySQL for the database.
It basically is a small library management system with very basic features including logging in as a librarian, viewing book status and details, issueing and returning book and also changing book details.
